A Dataset is a strongly typed collection of domain-specific objects that can be transformed in parallel using functional or relational operations. Each Dataset also has an untyped view called a DataFrame, which is a Dataset of Row.
Operations available on Datasets are divided into transformations and actions. Transformations are the ones that produce new Datasets, and actions are the ones that trigger computation and return results. Example transformations include map, filter, select, and aggregate (groupBy). Example actions count, show, or writing data out to file systems.

Datasets are "lazy", i.e. computations are only triggered when an action is invoked. Internally, a Dataset represents a logical plan that describes the computation required to produce the data. When an action is invoked, Spark's query optimizer optimizes the logical plan and generates a physical plan for efficient execution in a parallel and distributed manner. To explore the logical plan as well as optimized physical plan, use the explain function.

To efficiently support domain-specific objects, an Encoder is required. The encoder maps the domain specific type T to Spark's internal type system. For example, given a class Person with two fields, name (string) and age (int), an encoder is used to tell Spark to generate code at runtime to serialize the Person object into a binary structure. This binary structure often has much lower memory footprint as well as are optimized for efficiency in data processing (e.g. in a columnar format). To understand the internal binary representation for data, use the schema function.

There are typically two ways to create a Dataset. The most common way is by pointing Spark to some files on storage systems, using the read function available on a SparkSession.

   val people = spark.read.parquet("...").as[Person]  // Scala
   Dataset<Person> people = spark.read().parquet("...").as(Encoders.bean(Person.class)); // Java
 
Datasets can also be created through transformations available on existing Datasets. For example, the following creates a new Dataset by applying a filter on the existing one:


   val names = people.map(_.name)  // in Scala; names is a Dataset[String]
   Dataset<String> names = people.map((Person p) -> p.name, Encoders.STRING)); // in Java 8
